Group Portfolio Project

About
We are a group of three computer science students working on this portfolio. Our project has a landing page and links to each student's profile. Each student has their own page to show their work, skills, and projects.

Pages Included
Landing Page: The main page of the website. It welcomes users and gives links to each student’s portfolio.
Student Profiles: Each of us has a separate page that shows who we are, what skills we have, and what projects we’ve worked on.

How to View the Project

Open the index.html file in your browser to see the landing page.
From there, you can click on any student's name to view their profile.
